# Brandon Reading Order-son

Create your own list of Sando books in your own order. Export them to pdf, print it, hang it on your fridge. The exported list has a checkboxes automatically placed next to each book. When you finish one book, check it off, go to the next. No more visiting wikipedia between each book or hunting in your photo album for that same screenshot from months ago.
